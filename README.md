# bgrep

\[WIP] A custom regular expression matcher coded in python

See `doc/` for the project step pdf files

`nfa/` acts as a library of all classes and functions needed to use bgrep

This project was made for an assignment in `ND CSE 30151: Theory of Computing`. 

Current errors: changes to nfa_module cause tests to fail in cp3

It was completed in a group by [Aaron Lewis](https://github.com/aaron-m-lewis) and [Colson Wells](https://github.com/mudcario350).
